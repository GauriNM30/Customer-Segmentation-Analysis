# Customer-Segmentation-Analysis
We have implemented a notebook which shows the analysis for customer segmentation using Customer Retail Dataset. The data has been grouped into 5 groups (which was calculated by elbow-line diagram). The inferences have been written in the end in the notebook.

## Dataset - 
We have used online retail dataset from UCI Machine Learning Repositary. This dataset contains all the transactions occurring for a UK-based and registered non-store online retail.
